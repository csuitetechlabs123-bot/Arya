How I Created This Hiring Poster in Figm

1. Gathered Visual Assets
   Imported the company logo and selected simple background textures and colors suitable for a clean corporate look.

2. Set Up the Figma Frame
   Created a poster-sized frame, added the light textured background, and positioned the colored curved lines on the right side for visual flow.

3. Added the Main Heading
   Inserted the text “WE ARE HIRING!”, styled it with bold serif fonts, and used a clear hierarchy by pairing it with the smaller “join our team” subtitle.

4. Added Domain & Role Sections
   Created two text blocks—DOMAIN and REQUIRED ROLE—with bullet points using checkmark icons.
   Kept spacing consistent to maintain readability.

5. Added the Call-to-Action
   Designed the “Apply now!” line in a highlight color and placed a rounded rectangle at the bottom containing the email address for CV submission.

6. Final Alignment & Export
   Adjusted spacing, aligned all text elements, refined colors for clarity, and exported the final poster as a high-quality jpg
