  BOOKCOVER CYBERSECURITY

  How i designed this bookcover

 1. Collected the Background Image
    Searched on Google for a cyber-themed digital tech background, downloaded a high-resolution image, and imported it into Figma.

 2. Set Up the Figma Frame
    Created a book-cover–sized frame and placed the background image inside it, adjusting the crop and positioning to fit the layout.

 3. Added the Main Title
    Inserted text layers for the title, used bold clean fonts, applied white color for contrast, and center-aligned everything.

 4. Added the Subtitle
    Added the small descriptive subtitle in yellow to make it visible without overpowering the main heading.

 5. Added the Author Name
    Placed the author name at the bottom in all caps and centered it for balance.

 6. Final Adjustments & Export
    Tweaked spacing, alignment, and contrast for clarity, then exported the final design as a high-quality PNG
